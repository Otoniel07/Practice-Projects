			<p>Founded in 2942, here at Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium we have made it our goal to find loving homes for our children. We are happy to report that our success rate is nearly 68% with our orphans growing up to become outsanding members of society such as bus drivers, suicide-booth repairmen, and local politicians!</p>
